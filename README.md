<h1>Spotidados - Music Analytics Project</h1>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
    Spotidados is a group project where we analyzed a music playlist provided in JSON format. Our team used React and JavaScript to develop a web application that processes and visualizes data from the playlist. The goal was to generate insightful lists, including the top 100 artists, top 100 songs, and top albums, providing a comprehensive view of the playlist's content.
